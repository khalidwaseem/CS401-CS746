Exercise #4 

The aim of this exercise is to understand the process state and specifically the memory descriptor 
and the process descriptor. 

Given a process identifier (pid) to a kernel module, the module performs the following tasks,

1. Identifies the process in the task list.
2. Walks through all the virtual memory area descriptions and summarizes each area. summary should 
   include output similar to or more than that reported by /proc/$PID/maps
3. Estimate the RSS (resident set size) of the process. The RSS is the set if in-memory physical pages 
   for a process. While the committed virtual memory region can be quite large the RSS can be quite 
   different. 
   The following sub-tasks will be required for this part: 
	- understand and implement a procedure for doing a page table walk in software for resolving 
	virtual addresses to a physical address. 
	- setup the resolution to span all pages in the the valid virtual address regions of the 
	process 
	- estimate RSS 
	- report RSS, virtual memory region statistics for each VMA 
	- repeat above to show similarity and differences in VMA sizes and RSS 
	- /proc/$PID/smaps for a possible set of output variables 
4. Demonstrate correctness and features for each sub-task.
