Exercise #6
 
The aim of this exercise is to understand interfacing with device files for implementing custom 
operations using the ioctl function. 

Tasks
1. Write a module that registers a char device and overrides its file operations, in particular the 
   ioctl function.
2. Creation of a char device and registration of module have to be included.
3. Implement a custom ioctl function that will be used to read or write data from a shared 
   kernel-allocated memory object.
4. Implement a user-space process that opens the file and reads/writes data using the custom ioctl 
   function.
5. Multiple user-space processes should be able to open the char device file and read/write 
   simultaneously from it.
6. Note: The shared memory object will require protection to enable safe concurrent access.
7. Addition of at least one feature not mentioned in the exercise description. the more the merrier!
