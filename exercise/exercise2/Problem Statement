Tasks

1. Write a sample loadable kernel module and verify that it works---can be loaded and removed.
2. Print output from the module to a syslog file.
3. Print output from the module to the console.
4. Extend the basic module to accept command line parameters. Add a simple conditional clause to do perform different tasks (e.g., print different outputs) based on input parameters.
5. Read value from any exported data variable from the kernel symbol table and print it. Print it a few times and explain behaviour. The value should change for each iteration.
